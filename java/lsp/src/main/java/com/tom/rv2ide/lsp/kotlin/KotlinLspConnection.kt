 * Minimal abstraction over the active Kotlin LSP transport/backend connection.
 *
 * The goal of this interface is to decouple higher-level Kotlin editing logic
 * (document sync, requests, workspace setup, formatting, diagnostics wiring)
 * from the concrete backend process implementation.
 *
 * The interface intentionally stays small so different Kotlin backends can share
 * the same upper-layer integration with minimal behavioral drift.
